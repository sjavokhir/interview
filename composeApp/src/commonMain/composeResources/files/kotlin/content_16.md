### What are the scope functions?

[Scope functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/scope-functions.html) are special functions that allow you to execute code within the context of an object. They simplify code by reducing boilerplate, enabling temporary object configurations, and enhancing readability. The most commonly used scope functions are `let`, `run`, `with`, `apply`, and `also`, each serving different use cases based on context and intended behavior.

#### `let`

The `let` function is used to execute a block of code on an object when a non-null result is needed. It returns the result of the block’s last expression and provides the object as `it`.

```kotlin
val name = "skydoves"
val message = name?.let {
    "Hello, $it!"
}
println(message) // Output: Hello, skydoves!
```

#### `run`

The `run` function combines object initialization and the execution of a code block. It returns the result of the block’s last expression and provides `this` as the context.

```kotlin
val message = "Welcome to Kotlin".run {
    length > 10
}
println(message) // Output: true
```

#### `with`

The `with` function is used for calling multiple methods on the same object without repeating its reference. It provides `this` as the context and returns the result of the last expression.

```kotlin
val developer = StringBuilder("skydoves")
with(developer) {
    append(" - Android Developer")
    println(toString()) // Output: skydoves - Android Developer
}
```

#### `apply`

The `apply` function is used for configuring an object. It returns the object itself, allowing method chaining or further operations after initialization. The context is provided as `this`.

```kotlin
val developer = StringBuilder("skydoves").apply {
    append(" - Android Developer")
}
println(developer.toString()) // Output: skydoves - Android Developer
```

#### `also`

The `also` function performs additional actions on an object while keeping the object itself as the return value. It provides the object as `it`.

```kotlin
val name = "skydoves".also {
    println("Logging: $it")
}
println(name) // Output: Logging: skydoves
              //         skydoves
```

#### Choosing the Right Scope Function

- Use **`let`** for nullable checks and transforming results.
- Use **`run`** when performing operations and returning a result.
- Use **`with`** for grouping method calls on an object.
- Use **`apply`** for configuring objects during initialization.
- Use **`also`** for performing additional actions without modifying the object.

#### Summary

Scope functions in Kotlin simplify code by providing object-specific execution contexts. Each function—`let`, `run`, `with`, `apply`, and `also`—serves a distinct purpose, enabling cleaner and more expressive code. Understanding their differences and appropriate use cases leads to more readable and maintainable Kotlin applications.
