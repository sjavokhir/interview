### What happens if you run null + null operation?

Adding `null + null` does not result in a compiler error. Instead, it returns the string `"nullnull"`. This happens because Kotlin implicitly converts `null` to its `String` representation when the `+` operator is used. In this context, the `+` operator concatenates the string `"null"` with another `"null"`, producing `"nullnull"`.

```kotlin
val result = null + null
println(result) // Output: nullnull
```

This behavior is possible because the `+` operator for `String` types is overloaded to perform string concatenation, and `null`, when used in a string context, is converted to the string `"null"`.

#### Why Does This Happen?

The Kotlin compiler interprets the `+` operator as a call to the `String.plus()` function if you were not overridden the operator. When either operand is `null`, Kotlin converts it into the string `"null"`. Hereâ€™s what effectively happens under the hood:

```kotlin
val result = "null".plus("null")
println(result) // Output: nullnull
```

#### Summary

In Kotlin, `null + null` results in `"nullnull"` due to implicit conversion of `null` to its string representation during string concatenation. This highlights the importance of understanding how Kotlin handles nullable values in different contexts to avoid unexpected results in your code.
