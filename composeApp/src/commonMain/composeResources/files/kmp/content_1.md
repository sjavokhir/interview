### What is Kotlin Multiplatform?

[Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-intro.html) is a framework by JetBrains that enables code sharing across multiple platforms while allowing platform-specific implementations where needed. It facilitates writing common business logic in Kotlin and reusing it across platforms like Android, iOS, web, desktop, and server-side environments.

#### Key Features of Kotlin Multiplatform

1. **Code Sharing:** KMP allows developers to write core business logic in shared modules and reuse it across platforms, reducing code duplication.

2. **Platform-Specific Code:** While business logic is shared, developers can implement platform-specific UI and features using native APIs when needed.

3. **Full Access to Native APIs:** Developers can interact with native libraries and frameworks directly from shared modules using platform-specific extensions.

4. **Interoperability:** KMP is fully compatible with existing Kotlin projects and integrates smoothly into Android, iOS, and web development environments.

5. **Supported Platforms:** Android (JVM), iOS (Arm64, X64), web (JavaScript), desktop (JVM), and server-side platforms like Linux and macOS.

#### Key Advantages

Kotlin Multiplatform offers superior performance efficiency by compiling shared business logic into platform-specific binaries, such as JVM bytecode for Android and native binaries for iOS. This direct compilation eliminates performance overheads common in other cross-platform frameworks like [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), which relies on a JavaScript bridge, or [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), which uses a custom rendering engine. The ability to access native APIs without intermediate layers ensures minimal runtime overhead, making Kotlin Multiplatform highly suitable for performance-critical applications where native speed and responsiveness are essential.

#### Kotlin Multiplatform Architecture

Kotlin Multiplatform does not include a built-in UI framework. Instead, it emphasizes sharing business logic while enabling developers to create platform-specific UIs for Android, iOS, and other targets. The primary concept is writing core business logic in Kotlin and reusing it across platforms like Android, JVM, iOS, macOS, JavaScript, and Linux. This approach maintains platform-specific UI flexibility, allowing developers to build native user interfaces while leveraging a shared codebase for essential logic and processes. This approach provides flexibility, as demonstrated in the illustration below:

#### Summary

Kotlin Multiplatform simplifies cross-platform development by enabling shared business logic while maintaining full native capabilities. Its flexibility, extensive platform support, and seamless interoperability make it a powerful solution for modern multi-platform app development.
