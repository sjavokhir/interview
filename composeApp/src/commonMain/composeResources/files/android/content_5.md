### Describe the Activity lifecycle

The Android **Activity lifecycle** describes the different states an activity goes through during its lifetime, from creation to destruction. Understanding these states is crucial for managing resources effectively, handling user input, and ensuring a smooth user experience. Here are the main stages of the Activity lifecycle:

1. **onCreate()**: This is the first method called when an activity is created. It's where you initialize the activity, set up UI components, and restore any saved instance state. It's only called once during the activity's lifecycle unless the activity is destroyed and recreated.

2. **onStart()**: The activity becomes visible to the user but is not yet interactive. This is called after **onCreate()** and before **onResume()**.

3. **onRestart()**: If the activity is stopped and then restarted (e.g., the user navigates back to it), this method is called before **onStart()**.

4. **onResume()**: The activity is in the foreground and the user can interact with it. This is where you resume any paused UI updates, animations, or input listeners.

5. **onPause()**: This is called when the activity is partially obscured by another activity (e.g., a dialog). The activity is still visible but not in focus. It's often used to pause operations like animations, sensor updates, or saving data.

6. **onStop()**: The activity is no longer visible to the user (for example, when another activity comes to the foreground). You should release resources that are not needed while the activity is stopped, such as background tasks or heavy objects.

7. **onDestroy()**: This is called before the activity is fully destroyed and removed from memory. It's the final clean-up method for releasing all remaining resources.

#### Summary

An activity goes through these methods based on user interactions and the Android system's management of app resources. Developers use these callbacks to manage transitions, conserve resources, and provide a smooth experience for users.
