### What are build variants and flavors?

The [build variants and flavors](https://developer.android.com/build/build-variants) provide a flexible way to create different versions of an application from a single codebase. This system allows developers to manage multiple configurations, such as development and production builds, or free and paid versions, efficiently within the same project.

#### Build Variants

A **build variant** is the result of combining a specific **build type** and **product flavor** (if flavors are defined). The Android Gradle Plugin generates build variants for each combination, allowing you to generate APKs or bundles tailored to various use cases.

Build types represent how the application is built, typically including:

- **Debug**: A build configuration used during development. It often includes debug tools, logs, and a debug certificate for testing.
- **Release**: A configuration optimized for distribution, often with minification, obfuscation, and signed with a release key for publishing to stores.

By default, every Android project includes `debug` and `release` build types. Developers can add custom build types to fit specific requirements.

#### Product Flavors

**Product flavors** allow developers to define different variations of an app, such as free vs. paid versions, or region-specific versions like `us` and `eu`. Each flavor can have its unique configuration, such as application ID, version name, or resources. This makes it easy to create tailored builds without duplicating code.

A typical `build.gradle` configuration with flavors might look like this:

```kotlin
android {
    ...
    flavorDimensions = "version"

    productFlavors {
        free {
            applicationId = "com.example.app.free"
            versionName = "1.0-free"
        }

        paid {
            applicationId = "com.example.app.paid"
            versionName = "1.0-paid"
        }
    }
}
```

With this setup, Android Gradle Plugin will create combinations like `freeDebug`, `freeRelease`, `paidDebug`, and `paidRelease`.

#### Combining Build Types and Flavors

The build variant system combines **build types** and **product flavors** to create a matrix of potential builds. For example:

- `freeDebug`: A free version for debugging.
- `paidRelease`: A paid version optimized for release.

Each combination can have its specific configuration, resources, or code. For instance, you might want to show ads in the free version but disable them in the paid version. You can use flavor-specific resource directories or Java/Kotlin code.

#### Advantages of Using Build Variants and Flavors

1. **Efficient Configuration Management**: It reduces duplication and allows handling multiple builds from a single codebase.
2. **Custom Behavior**: You can tailor app behavior, such as enabling premium features in paid versions or using different APIs for debug vs. release builds.
3. **Automation**: Gradle automates tasks like APK signing, shrinking, and obfuscation based on the variant.

#### Summary

Build variants in Android combine build types and product flavors to produce tailored app builds. Build types define configurations for how the app is built (e.g., `debug` vs. `release`), while product flavors define variations of the app (e.g., `free` vs. `paid`). Together, they create a powerful system for managing multiple app configurations, ensuring efficiency and scalability in development and deployment.
