### How Android handles memory management, and how can you avoid memory leaks?

Android manages memory through a **garbage collection** mechanism that automatically reclaims unused memory, ensuring efficient allocation for active applications and services. It relies on a managed memory environment, which means developers don’t need to manually allocate and deallocate memory as in languages like C++. The Dalvik or ART runtime monitors memory usage, cleans up objects no longer referenced, and prevents excessive memory consumption.

Android uses a **low-memory killer** to terminate background processes when the system is low on memory, prioritizing the smooth functioning of the foreground application. Developers must ensure their apps efficiently utilize resources to minimize the impact on system performance.

#### How to Avoid Memory Leaks in Android

Memory leaks occur when an application holds references to objects no longer needed, preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming memory. Common causes include improper lifecycle management, static references, or retaining a long-lived reference to a context.

##### Best Practices to Avoid Memory Leaks

1. **Use Lifecycle-Aware Components**  
   Leveraging lifecycle-aware components such as `ViewModel` and `Flow` with [collectAsStateWithLifecycle](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/compose/package-summary#extension-functions) or `LiveData` ensures resources are released properly when the corresponding lifecycle ends. These components automatically manage their cleanup when the associated lifecycle is no longer active or transitions to a specific state.

2. **Avoid Holding References to Context**  
   Avoid retaining references to `Activity` or `Context` in long-lived objects such as static fields or singletons. Instead, use `ApplicationContext` when possible, as it is not tied to the lifecycle of an activity or fragment.

3. **Unregister Listeners and Callbacks**  
   Always unregister listeners, observers, or callbacks in appropriate lifecycle methods. For example, unregister `BroadcastReceivers` in `onPause()` or `onStop()`.

4. **WeakReferences for Non-Critical Objects**  
   Use `WeakReference` for objects that don’t need strong references. This allows the garbage collector to reclaim them when memory is needed.

5. **Use Tools to Detect Leaks**  
   Utilize tools like [LeakCanary](https://square.github.io/leakcanary/) to identify and fix memory leaks during development. This tool provides insights into what objects are causing memory leaks and how to resolve them. But also, you can utilize the [Memory Profiler](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/memory-profiler) on Android Studio that helps you identify memory leaks and memory churn that can lead to stutter, freezes, and even app crashes.

6. **Avoid Static References to Views**  
   Views should not be stored in static fields, as this can lead to memory leaks by holding references to the `Activity` context.

7. **Close Resources**  
   Always release resources like file streams, cursors, or database connections explicitly when they are no longer needed. For instance, close a `Cursor` after a database query.

8. **Use Fragments and Activities Wisely**  
   Avoid overusing fragments or holding references between them improperly. Clean up fragment references in `onDestroyView()` or `onDetach()`.

#### Summary

Android's memory management is efficient but requires developers to follow best practices to prevent memory leaks. Using lifecycle-aware components, avoiding static references to context or views, and leveraging tools like LeakCanary can significantly reduce the chances of leaks. Proper resource management and cleanup during appropriate lifecycle events ensure smoother app performance and user experience.
