### What's Application class?

The `Application` class in Android serves as the base class for maintaining global application state and lifecycle. It acts as the entry point for an app, initialized before any other components such as activities, services, or broadcast receivers. The `Application` class provides a context that is available throughout the app's lifecycle, making it ideal for initializing shared resources.

#### Purpose of the Application Class

The `Application` class is designed to hold global state and perform application-wide initialization. Developers often override this class to set up dependencies, configure libraries, and manage resources that need to persist across activities and services.

By default, every Android application uses a base implementation of the `Application` class unless a custom class is specified in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

#### Key Methods in the Application Class

1. **`onCreate()`**:
   The `onCreate()` method is called when the app process is created. This is where you typically initialize application-wide dependencies, such as database instances, network libraries, or analytics tools. It is invoked only once during the application lifecycle.

2. **`onTerminate()`**:
   This method is called when the application is terminated in emulated environments. It is not called on real devices in production, as Android does not guarantee its invocation.

3. **`onLowMemory()` and `onTrimMemory()`**:
   These methods are triggered when the system detects low memory conditions. `onLowMemory()` is used for older API levels, while `onTrimMemory()` provides more granular control based on the appâ€™s current memory state.

#### How to Use the Application Class

To define a custom `Application` class, you need to extend the `Application` class and specify it in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file under the `<application>` tag.

```kotlin
class CustomApplication : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        // Initialize global dependencies
        initializeDatabase()
        initializeAnalytics()
    }

    private fun initializeDatabase() {
        // Set up a database instance
    }

    private fun initializeAnalytics() {
        // Configure analytics tracking
    }
}
```

```xml
<application
    android:name=".CustomApplication"
    ... >
    ...
</application>
```

#### Use Cases for the Application Class

1. **Dependency Injection**: You can initialize frameworks like Dagger or Hilt to provide dependencies across the app.
2. **Global Resource Management**: Resources such as databases, shared preferences, or network clients can be set up once and reused.
3. **Analytics Initialization**: Tools like Google Analytics or Firebase can be configured during the application startup.
4. **Crash Reporting**: Crash reporting tools like Sentry or Crashlytics are commonly initialized here.

#### Best Practices

1. Avoid performing long-running tasks in `onCreate()` to prevent delays in launching the app.
2. Do not use the `Application` class as a dumping ground for unrelated logic. Keep it focused on global initialization and resource management.
3. Ensure thread safety when managing shared resources in the `Application` class.

#### Summary

The `Application` class is a central place for initializing and managing resources that need to be available across the entire app. While it is a powerful tool for global configuration, its use should be limited to tasks that are truly global to maintain clarity and avoid unnecessary complexity.
