### Parcel and Parcelable

`Parcel` is a container class in Android that enables high-performance inter-process communication (IPC) between different components of an application (such as activities, services, or broadcast receivers). It is primarily used for marshaling (flattening) and unmarshaling (unflattening) data so that it can be passed across Android's IPC boundaries.

A `Parcel` in Android is a container used to send both flattened data and references to live `IBinder` objects through an inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism. Itâ€™s designed for high-performance IPC transport, enabling objects (using the `Parcelable` interface) to be serialized and passed efficiently between components. `Parcel` isn't a general-purpose serialization tool and should not be used for persistent storage, as its underlying implementation can change and make older data unreadable.

The API includes various methods for reading and writing primitive data types, arrays, and Parcelable objects, allowing objects to serialize themselves and reconstruct when needed. Additionally, there are optimized methods for working with `Parcelables` that omit writing class information, requiring the reader to know the type in advance for efficient data handling.

`Parcelable` is an Android-specific interface used to serialize objects so they can be passed through a Parcel. Objects that implement `Parcelable` can be written to and restored from a Parcel, making it suitable for passing complex data between Android components.

#### In Summary:

- Parcel: A container for transmitting data between components using IPC, supporting various data types.
- Parcelable: An interface that enables objects to be flattened into a `Parcel` for efficient transmission.
