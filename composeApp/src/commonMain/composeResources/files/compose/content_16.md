### Stateful vs. Stateless Composables in Jetpack Compose

In Jetpack Compose, composables can be categorized into **stateful** and **stateless** based on whether they manage and store their own state or rely on external sources for state management. Understanding the distinction between these two types is essential for building scalable, reusable, and maintainable UI components.

### Stateful Composables

A **stateful composable** manages its own state internally. It encapsulates the state logic within the composable, providing a self-contained UI element. This makes it easier to use but less reusable and harder to test because the state management is tightly coupled with the composable's behavior.

#### Key Characteristics
Stateful composables encapsulate state within the composable, providing default behavior and handling user interactions internally. They are less flexible as they limit external control over the composable's state.

#### Example: Stateful Counter

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Counter() {
    var count by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }

    Button(onClick = { count++ }) {
        Text("Count: $count")
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Counter` composable manages its own `count` state. Each time the button is clicked, the state is updated internally.

#### Use Cases
Stateful composables are suitable for simple, self-contained UI elements with limited state requirements. They are useful when the composable's behavior is independent of external state.

### Stateless Composables

A **stateless composable** relies on external sources for state management. It only renders the UI based on the state passed to it and communicates changes back to the caller via callbacks. Stateless composables are more reusable, testable, and composable as they separate state management from UI logic.

#### Key Characteristics
Stateless composables do not manage state internally. They require state and event callbacks as parameters, making them highly reusable and flexible for various contexts.

#### Example: Stateless Counter

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Counter(count: Int, onIncrement: () -> Unit) {
    Button(onClick = onIncrement) {
        Text("Count: $count")
    }
}
```

Here, the `Counter` composable receives `count` and `onIncrement` as parameters. The state is managed externally, and the composable updates the UI based on the provided `count`.

#### Use Cases
Stateless composables are ideal for reusable components that are part of larger state management systems. They are suitable for UI components used in multiple contexts with varying state sources.

### Summary

Stateful composables encapsulate state internally, making them simpler to use but less flexible and reusable. Stateless composables, on the other hand, rely on external state management, providing greater reusability and testability. Combining both approaches, with stateful wrappers around stateless composables, allows for clean and scalable UI design in Jetpack Compose.
