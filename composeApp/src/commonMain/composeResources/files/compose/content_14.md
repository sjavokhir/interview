### What's the derivedStateOf?

The `derivedStateOf` is a state management utility used to create a **state object** that derives its value from other observable states. This is particularly useful when you need to compute a value based on multiple state objects but want to ensure the computation is performed only when the relevant dependent state changes. This optimization helps prevent unnecessary recompositions and improves performance.

#### Purpose and Functionality

The primary purpose of `derivedStateOf` is to encapsulate derived computations in a way that Compose can efficiently track dependencies. When used, it ensures that recompositions are triggered only when the values it depends on change.

#### Why Use `derivedStateOf`?

Jetpack Compose's reactive model automatically triggers recompositions whenever an observable state changes. However, if you derive some value from multiple states directly inside a composable, it can lead to redundant computations or recompositions, especially when not all changes are relevant.

`derivedStateOf` solves this issue by making the derived value recomposition-aware, updating only when its dependent state actually changes.

#### Practical Usage of `derivedStateOf`

Consider a scenario where a list of items needs to be filtered based on a search query. Without `derivedStateOf`, the filtering logic might run repeatedly, even if the underlying state hasn't changed in a way that affects the result. With `derivedStateOf`, Compose ensures the filtering logic runs only when required.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun SearchScreen(items: List<String>, query: String) {
    val filteredItems by remember(items, query) {
        derivedStateOf {
            items.filter { it.contains(query, ignoreCase = true) }
        }
    }

    LazyColumn {
        items(filteredItems) { item ->
            Text(text = item)
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `filteredItems` state is derived from `items` and `query`.
- The filtering computation runs only when `items` or `query` changes, optimizing performance.

#### Key Benefits of `derivedStateOf`

1. **Performance Optimization**: Prevents unnecessary recompositions by limiting computations to relevant state changes.
2. **Declarative Design**: Encapsulates derived computations in a way that aligns with Compose's reactive and declarative principles.
3. **Reduced Boilerplate**: Eliminates the need for manually tracking dependencies, as Compose does it automatically.

#### Summary

`derivedStateOf` in Jetpack Compose is a good API for optimizing performance by ensuring derived computations are only triggered by relevant state changes. It is especially useful in scenarios where recomposition could lead to expensive operations, such as filtering large datasets or complex calculations. Using `derivedStateOf` helps you write efficient, maintainable, and responsive UI code.
