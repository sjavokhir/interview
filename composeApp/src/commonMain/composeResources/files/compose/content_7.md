### `collectAsStateWithLifecycle` in Jetpack Compose

Unlike `collectAsState`, `collectAsStateWithLifecycle` is lifecycle-aware, allowing your app to conserve resources based on the Android lifecycle, such as when the app is in the background. This helps prevent unnecessary resource usage, which can negatively impact device performance and battery life.

If you look under the hood of `collectAsStateWithLifecycle`, you'll find that it leverages the `repeatOnLifecycle` API, the recommended approach for safely consuming flows in Android while adhering to the lifecycle system.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun <T> Flow<T>.collectAsStateWithLifecycle(
    initialValue: T,
    lifecycle: Lifecycle,
    minActiveState: Lifecycle.State = Lifecycle.State.STARTED,
    context: CoroutineContext = EmptyCoroutineContext
): State<T> {
    return produceState(initialValue, this, lifecycle, minActiveState, context) {
        lifecycle.repeatOnLifecycle(minActiveState) {
            if (context == EmptyCoroutineContext) {
                this@collectAsStateWithLifecycle.collect { this@produceState.value = it }
            } else withContext(context) {
                this@collectAsStateWithLifecycle.collect { this@produceState.value = it }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`collectAsStateWithLifecycle` enables you to observe a Flow in sync with the Android lifecycle. It begins collecting when the lifecycle reaches the specified `minActiveState` (which defaults to `onStart`) and stops collecting when the lifecycle reaches `onStop`.

This ensures that flow collection halts to free up app resources when your application is no longer visible on the screen or is about to be destroyed. As a result, you can safely release data layer resources when they are no longer needed, optimizing resource usage and enhancing overall efficiency.
